      <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:rebeccapurple;background-color:coral">
      <p>Dutch police arrested a suspect on Tuesday in the theft last year of two valuable paintings by Vincent van Gogh
        and Frans Hals from different museums.

        The paintings, however, are still missing.

        In a statement posted on Twitter, police spokeswoman Maren Wonder said a 58-year-old man was arrested at his
        home
        in the Dutch town of Baarn, 40 kilometres southeast of Amsterdam. His identity was not released, in line with
        Dutch privacy guidelines.
        <br><br>
        “Unfortunately, we haven’t yet recovered the paintings and the investigation is continuing,” Wonder said. She
        called the arrest “a really important step in the investigation.”

        Van Gogh's “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884” was snatched from the Singer Laren museum east of
        Amsterdam in the early hours of March 30, 2020. The museum was closed at the time due to a coronavirus lockdown.

        The 25-by-57-centimetre oil-on-paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a
        church tower in the background.

      <p>The Hals work, “Two Laughing Boys”, was stolen some five months later from Museum Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden
        in
        Leerdam, 60 kilometres south of Amsterdam.

        The Van Gogh painting was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands when a burglar smashed through
        reinforced glass doors to get into the Singer Laren, which is less than 10 kilometres from the town where the
        suspect was arrested.

        Singer Laren spokeswoman Esther Driessen welcomed the arrest and said she hopes it leads detectives to the
        painting.
        “The most important thing is that the painting returns as quickly as possible to the Groninger Museum, where it
        belongs,” she said.
        <br><br>
        The Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden had no comment on the arrest. Police said last year that the same Hals painting
        was stolen in 1988 together with a work by Jacob van Ruisdael. Both were recovered three years later.

        In 2011, the two paintings were again stolen and recovered six months later.
